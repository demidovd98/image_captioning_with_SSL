# Image captioning with self-supervised learning for visual feature extraction


1. The code for the project and clear instructions on running the code, 
2. A readme file (text or markdown file) to specify the function of each component (file/folder) in the codebase, 
3. List all dependencies used in the project, and provide instructions on installing any dependencies (e.g., pytorch, cudatoolkit, scikit-learn, etc.) 
4. Provide a demo file available with sample inputs and outputs.
5. Provide instructions on downloading data from publicly available links (for the datasets used in the project)
6. If a project is built on an existing code-base, it must be clearly credited and differences should be explicitly stated in the readme file.
